# Alina Bolindu

    Domain Architect at Robert Bosch RO (Cluj)


## What should I keep doing? What works well?

> Keep being the amazing colleague you’ve always been!  Your ability to stay professional while being approachable and positive creates a great work environment. The way you handle discussions, even when we have differing opinions, is remarkable. You’re always open to negotiation and focused on finding the best solution. I truly admire your reliability and consistency in delivering what you commit to, and your positive attitude lifts the mood of the entire team.
I also have to highlight how much you’ve grown technically over the past year. The progress you’ve made in Spring Boot, following the feedback I shared last year.  It’s clear you put in the effort, and it really shows in your work.
On top of that, stepping into the solution architect role and managing technical implementations for external teams is no small feat, and you’ve handled it like a pro. Plus, your constant focus on clean, maintainable code sets a great example for the team and raises the overall quality of our projects. Keep doing what you’re doing!

## What do you see as my strength?

> Your attention to detail and trustworthiness are top-notch. You’re the person everyone can count on, no matter how busy things get. You’re great at prioritizing, staying organized even under pressure, and always ready to lend a hand when someone needs it. Your positive attitude is contagious. You have this way of lifting the team’s mood, which makes a huge difference in our day-to-day work.
Your technical growth has been impressive, denoting your ability to adapt and improve, which shows a strong growth mindset. Your transition to a solution architect role, where you now handle complex technical implementations and guide external teams, highlights not just technical skills but also leadership and the ability to think strategically.

## Any other comments or recommendations how to improve my work?

> Honestly, you’re doing an incredible job, and it’s hard to find areas for improvement. If there’s one thing to consider, it would be to ensure you’re not overloading yourself. While your dedication is admirable, taking time to manage your well-being is just as important as the work you deliver.
