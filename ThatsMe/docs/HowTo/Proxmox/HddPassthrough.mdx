# Passthrough a Physical HDD to a in Proxmox VE Virtual Machine

## Requirements
- Installed harddrives in your proxmox Machine

## Configure Proxmox
To passthrough a physical HDD there are two essencial steps
1. Identify the HDD that should be passed
2. Add the HDD to the virtual machine

### Identify the Drives UID
There are several ways to identify the drives and their unique IDs.
The one that works out of the box is by applying the command `lsblk -o +MODEL,SERIAL`

Doing it like this, you will receive a list of all your detected drives

```bash

root@pve:~# lsblk -o +MODEL,SERIAL
...
NAME                         MAJ:MIN RM   SIZE RO TYPE MOUNTPOINTS     MODEL                SERIAL
sda                            8:0    0   3.6T  0 disk                 WDC WD40EFPX-68C6CN0 WD-XXXXXXXXXXX1
├─sda1                         8:1    0     2G  0 part
└─sda2                         8:2    0   3.6T  0 part
sdb                            8:16   0   3.6T  0 disk                 WDC WD40EFPX-68C6CN0 WD-XXXXXXXXXXX2
├─sdb1                         8:17   0     2G  0 part
└─sdb2                         8:18   0   3.6T  0 part
...
```

The essential part in the shown table is the column `SERIAL` - This serial is used to identify the HDD.

### Identify the Drives Full Name
Now that you know which drives are available and how to identify them, you can check the full name.

All the drives and their full-names can be found in the directory `/dev/disk/by-id` - So just list them all with the command `ls /dev/disk/by-id/`

```bash
root@pve:~# ls /dev/disk/by-id/
...
ata-WDC_WD40EFPX-68C6CN0_WD-XXXXXXXXXXX1
ata-WDC_WD40EFPX-68C6CN0_WD-XXXXXXXXXXX1-part1
ata-WDC_WD40EFPX-68C6CN0_WD-XXXXXXXXXXX1-part2
ata-WDC_WD40EFPX-68C6CN0_WD-XXXXXXXXXXX2
ata-WDC_WD40EFPX-68C6CN0_WD-XXXXXXXXXXX2-part1
ata-WDC_WD40EFPX-68C6CN0_WD-XXXXXXXXXXX2-part2
...
```
Maybe you noticed the last part of the drives names is the same as the one listed in the initial tables `SERIAL` column

### Create the Drives Full Path
The hardest part is already done.
You identified your drives UID and its corresponding full name.

We already talked about the path, where to find the drives UIDs.

Alltogether this information allows us to create the full-path which is `path + fullname`

e.g.<br/>
For the drive `ata-WDC_WD40EFPX-68C6CN0_WD-XXXXXXXXXXX1` it would be <br/>
`/dev/disk/by-id/ata-WDC_WD40EFPX-68C6CN0_WD-XXXXXXXXXXX1`


## Add the Drive to your Virtual Machine

First identify your virtual machines ID - This could easily be found on your Proxmox WebUI. It`s a simple integer that identifies your VM.

e.g.<br/>
Let`s assume a VM with the ID `100`
To add your drive `ata-WDC_WD40EFPX-68C6CN0_WD-XXXXXXXXXXX`, all you need to do, is just apply the following command

```bash
qm set 100 -scsi2 /dev/disk/by-id/ata-WDC_WD40EFPX-68C6CN0_WD-XXXXXXXXXXX1
update 100 -scsi2 /dev/disk/by-id/ata-WDC_WD40EFPX-68C6CN0_WD-XXXXXXXXXXX1
```
Or in a more abstract way
```bash
qm set <VM UID> -scsi2 <drives full path>
```

et voila - You mounted a phiscal drive directly to your virtual machine.


for this particular example we used the scsi2 driver, but you can also apply other like `IDE` or `SATA`.
